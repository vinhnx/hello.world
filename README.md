iOS developer at [2359 Media](http://2359media.com/), currently living in Ho Chi Minh city.

When not writing [code](https://github.com/vinhnx), you can find me reading [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vinhnx), exploring [Github](https://github.com/vinhnx), posting photos at [Instagram](https://instagram.com/vinhnx) or reading tweets at [@vinhnx](https://twitter.com/@vinhnx).

I love listening to [podcasts](https://vinhnx.github.io/podcasts/)

I used to write things with [@getWriteDown](https://twitter.com/getWriteDown), and check weather forecast with [@HumidTheApp](https://twitter.com/HumidTheApp). [App Store link](http://itunes.com/nguyenvinh), but these apps are no longer available.
