Hi! I'm Vinh Nguyen.

Currently, I work at [2359](http://2359media.com/), in Ho Chi Minh city as iOS software developer.

When not writing [code](https://github.com/vinhnx), I love reading [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vinhnx), and exploring open source projects on [Github](https://github.com/vinhnx). On my spare time, I occasionally post photos on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/vinhnx) or reading tweets at [@vinhnx](https://twitter.com/@vinhnx).

I'm an avid [podcasts](https://vinhnx.github.io/podcasts/) listener.

In the past, I started learning iOS and then end-up creating two iOS apps, before working fulltime:
+ A markdown text editor with cloud sync [@getWriteDown](https://twitter.com/getWriteDown)
+ A weather forecast app with text-to-speech (think Weather app for busy people) [@HumidTheApp](https://twitter.com/HumidTheApp). 

My [App Store link](http://itunes.com/nguyenvinh), but these apps are no longer available, I hope to revive them someday :)

My programming interests include: Swift, Objective-C, iOS. learning: JavaScript/NodeJS. I like: Rust, Go, Open-Source softwares, Git, GitHub, Unix and command-line tools.
